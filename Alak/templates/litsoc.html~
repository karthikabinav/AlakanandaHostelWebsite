   <h3 style="text-align:center"> Alak and how it has Lit (the) Soc on fire</h3>
   <p> &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspLit Soc encompasses all the inter hostel literary and social activity and competitions that take place on the campus. The events range from speaking events like debate and the hugely entertaining JAM to the sober yet fiercely contested word games like Crossie and Scrabble; from the group music events which are held in front of packed audiences to the equally well followed conglomerate of quizzes- the similarity between the two? Well, both go well into the night; besides, like any other event here, are followed by the exultations and heartburn that characterize contests where pride and pride alone are at stake. Pride in representing one's hostel, pride associated with the responsibility that one has been thrust upon by the legacy that has been set in the past, pride in building upon that foundation of glory and taking it continually to a whole new dimension.</p>
    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspAlak has never been devoid of champion material and has a rich history of magnificent performers, especially on stage. The enigmatic "Cubba" and the all round genius "Stick" have been our most prolific performers in Lit soc over the past few years. Cubba was the undisputed best at dramatics, debates and playing the guitar, while Stick's treble of winning LM - solo, LM - group and WM - group last year is the stuff of legends. The lit-soc community of Alak bows to them.</p>

    <p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspMusic continues to be an Alak stronghold. The mantle has been passed on to the next generation and we continue to win with Alak emerging at the top of the competition in Western Music group and solo last year primarily through the genius of Akaash, Sabu and the rest of Babas Black Sheep. The sweet sound of victory seemingly remains a Monopoly of Alak and shall remain so in the foreseeable future.
We also came up with a sterling performance in the Choreo Nite last year and have a well set and confident troupe eagerly waiting to maul the rest once again.</p>

    <h4 style="text-align:center">Facilities for Lit-Soc</h4>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp1.	Music Room - Alak has perhaps the best equipped hostel-music room on campus. We currently own two electric guitars, a bass guitar, a set of jazz drums, mixer, amplifier - all coupled with powerful speakers. Located in a quaint corner of the premises, it facilitates round the clock usage without causing acoustic disturbance to the hostel's quieter residents. (the monkeys)</p>
<p>&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp2.	Library - Alak boasts a well stocked library run and maintained by fresher-volunteers and the Literary Affairs Secretary. We currently own a good number of Jeffrey Archers, Arthur Haileys, Dan Browns, etc among others and the collection keeps growing.</p>
